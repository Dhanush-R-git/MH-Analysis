Contact a suicide hotline in India for free support

Suicidal thoughts can affect anyone. They are more common than you might think, which is why there are 20 suicide hotlines (or helplines and crisis lines) in India that can offer help to anyone struggling with feeling suicidal. Suicidal thoughts might involve:




Losing your motivation to keep going




Thinking there is nothing worth living for




Thinking that the world would be better off without you




Feeling or thinking you are worthless




Fascination with the concept of death and dying




A deep sense of hopelessness




Feeling a deep sense of loneliness or isolation




Feeling like you can't cope with the pain anymore




When you're suicidal, you're going through an emotional crisis. Being in crisis mode can give rise to intense emotions that are difficult to process. You may be overwhelmed and want nothing more than for the pain to end. It may not seem like it, but things can get better.

Even though things might feel hopeless, getting support from someone who cares can make a big difference. Speaking to a crisis counselor in India may help you see that there is a light at the end of the dark tunnel you are in right now.

If you are having thoughts of suicide today, consider contacting a helpline in India for free, confidential help.
