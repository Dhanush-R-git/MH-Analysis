Minimizing the chronic 

stress

 of daily life as much as possible can support your overall health. Chronic stress can increase your risk of health conditions, including:

heart disease

anxiety disorders

depression

Certain factors may affect your vulnerability to stress. These can include:

genetics

Trusted Source

level of social support

coping style

personality type

discrimination due to race, gender, or perceived gender, LBGTQIA+, socioeconomic status, or other factors

childhood trauma

your 

profession

Stress and mental health conditions

Stress isn’t the same as mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Although the tips below may relieve many types of stress, they are not a substitute for treatment from a mental health professional.

Share on Pinterest

1. Get more physical activity 

A 

6-week study

Trusted Source

 of 185 university students found that participating in 

aerobic exercise

 2 days per week significantly reduced overall perceived stress and perceived stress due to uncertainty. 

The 

CDC

Trusted Source

 recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, as well as two days of muscle-strengthening activity.

If you’re currently inactive, start with gentle activities such as 

walking or biking

. Choosing an activity you enjoy can help increase your chances of sticking to it in the long term. 

2. Eat a balanced diet 

A 

2022 review of research

Trusted Source

 suggests that people who follow a diet high in 

ultra-processed foods

 and 

added sugar

 are more likely to experience higher perceived stress levels.

Additionally, being chronically stressed 

may lead you

 to 

overeat

 and consume more ultra-processed foods.

If you do not eat enough nutrient-dense whole foods, you may increase your risk of deficiencies in nutrients essential for regulating stress and mood, such as 

magnesium

 and 

B vitamins

.

Minimizing your intake of highly processed foods and beverages and eating more 

whole foods

 can help ensure your body is properly nourished, and it may improve your resilience to stress. 

Whole food options can include:

vegetables

fruits

beans

fish

nuts

seeds

Meals with whole foods

Chicken and squash bake

Green bean salad with quinoa and feta

Tomato, orzo, and white bean soup

Summer roll bowls

Superfoods shake

3. Minimize screen time  

A 

2021 review of literature

Trusted Source

 points out that several studies have linked 

excessive smartphone use

 with increased stress levels.

Screen time may also negatively affect sleep, which 

may also lead

Trusted Source

 to increased stress levels.

4. Practice self-care

Self-care doesn’t have to be elaborate or complicated. It simply means tending to your well-being and happiness. Engaging in self-care is associated with 

lower levels of stress and improved quality of life

Trusted Source

. 

Examples of self-care include:

going for a 

walk

 outside

taking a bath

lighting candles

reading

 a good book

exercising

preparing a 

healthy meal

stretching before bed

getting a 

massage

practicing a hobby

using a diffuser with calming scents

practicing yoga

5. Try journaling

Journaling

 may help 

reduce

Trusted Source

 stress and provide a positive outlet for your thoughts and emotions.

You can also try a 

guided journal

 if you’d prefer more targeted, expressive writing.

6. Reduce your caffeine intake

Consuming too much 

caffeine

 may worsen stress, according to a 

2021 review of literature

Trusted Source

. Overconsumption may also harm your sleep, which can increase stress.

Although 

coffee has health benefits

 in moderation, it’s recommended to keep caffeine intake under 

400 mg

Trusted Source

 daily, which equals 4–5 cups (0.9–1.2 L) of coffee.

Coffee alternatives

Matcha green tea shake

Vanilla chai tea shake

Chai spice shake

Carrot ginger smoothie

7. Spend time with loved ones

Having a social support system is important for your overall mental health. 

A 

2019 study

Trusted Source

 in 163 ​​Latinx college-age young adults associated lower levels of support from friends, family, and romantic partners with higher perceived stress.

If you do not have friends or family to depend on, social support groups may help. Consider joining a club or sports team or volunteering for a cause that’s important to you.

8. Create boundaries and learn to say no

Being selective about what you take on — and saying “no” to things that will unnecessarily add to your load — can reduce your stress levels.

Creating boundaries

, especially with people who add to your stress levels, is a healthy way to protect your well-being. 

This can be as simple as asking a friend or family member not to stop by unannounced or taking a rain check on plans if you are feeling overwhelmed.

9. Avoid procrastination

Procrastination

 can cause stress, which negatively affects your health and sleep quality. You may also be 

more likely

Trusted Source

 to procrastinate in times of stress as a coping mechanism.

A 

study

Trusted Source

 in 140 medical students linked procrastination to increased stress levels. 

If you find yourself procrastinating regularly, it may be helpful to make 

a to-do list

. Give yourself realistic deadlines and work your way down the list in order of priority. Sometimes, adding an item to the list may help you feel better about it, even if it doesn’t get done immediately.

10. Take a yoga class

Research

Trusted Source

 shows that 

yoga

 can help reduce stress and promote psychological well-being.

Yoga 

may also help

Trusted Source

 lower cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate while increasing levels of 

gamma aminobutyric acid

, a neurotransmitter that’s low in people with mood disorders.

11. Practice mindfulness

Stress reduction techniques that utilize 

mindfulness

 include meditation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a type of 

cognitive behavioral therapy

.

Meditating consistently, even for short periods, 

may help boost

Trusted Source

 your mood and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety. 

There are many 

apps and websites

 that can help you get started with meditation. There may also be therapists in your area who specialize in MBCT.

How to hold space

Holding space

 is a form of mindfulness that can reduce stress. It involves allowing yourself to feel your emotions without self-criticism. Learn 

how to hold space for yourself.

12. Cuddle

Studies

Trusted Source

 show positive 

physical contact

 may help relieve stress.

These types of contact may help 

release oxytocin

Trusted Source

 and 

lower cortisol

. In turn, these effects help 

lower blood pressure

 and heart rate. 

High blood pressure

 and increased heart rate are physical symptoms of stress.

13. Spend time in nature

A 

review of 14 studies

Trusted Source

 found that spending as little as 10 minutes in a 

natural setting

 may help improve psychological and physiological markers of mental well-being, including perceived stress, in college-aged people.

Hiking

 and camping are great options, but some people don’t enjoy — or have access to — these activities. Even in an urban area, you can seek out green spaces such as:

local parks

arboretums

botanical gardens

14. Practice deep breathing

Studies

 have associated diaphragmatic breathing with stress reduction.

Deep 

breathing exercises

 include:

diaphragmatic breathing

alternate nostril breathing

box breathing

Deep breathing aims to focus your awareness on your breath, making it slower and deeper. When you breathe in deeply through your nose, your lungs fully expand, and your belly rises. This helps slow your heart rate.

15. Spend time with a pet

Having a pet may 

help reduce

Trusted Source

 stress and improve your mood. When you cuddle or touch your pet, your body releases 

oxytocin

 — a hormone linked to positive moods.

Having a pet may also help relieve stress by:

giving you purpose

keeping you active

providing companionship

16. Consider supplements

Several vitamins and minerals play an important role in your body’s stress response and mood regulation. A deficiency in one or more nutrients may affect your mental health and ability to cope with stress.

For example, your magnesium levels may deplete when you’re chronically stressed. 

Since this mineral plays an important role in your body’s stress response, you may want to ensure you’re getting enough each day. Supplementing with 

magnesium

 has 

been linked

Trusted Source

 to decreased stress in chronically stressed people.

A note on supplements

It is important to talk to a doctor before starting any supplement, even if it is available over-the-counter. 

Dietary supplements may not be appropriate for everyone, and your doctor will be able to take your individual needs into account.

The takeaway

Being chronically stressed can take a toll on your physical and mental health. 

Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, spending time with a pet, minimizing screen time, and getting outside more often are all ways that you can reduce stress.
