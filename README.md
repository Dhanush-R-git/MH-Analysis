# Maṉa
Maṉa is a web-based application designed to analyze mental health via social media interactions. The system leverages user-generated comments on posts and tweets to assess emotional well-being. By aggregating social media data through APIs or user uploads, Maṉa employs a fine-tuned RoBERTa model to perform sentiment analysis, classifying interactions as either positive or negative. When negative sentiments prevail, the system activates MaṉaNow—a dynamic questioning AI that conducts an in-depth mental health assessment through a series of targeted questions and ultimately generates a personalized report. In parallel, MaṉaChat provides an instructional conversational interface, powered by the meta llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model, to offer immediate stress-reduction strategies and mental health guidance. This dual approach not only enhances user engagement but also ensures timely intervention by coupling real-time analysis with supportive resources.

## MHRoberta (a Large Language Model for mental health analysis) (** in progress)

We developed our own model called 'MHRoberta' is Mental Health Roberta model. It is pretrained Roberta transformer based model fine-tunned on Mental Health dataset by adopting PEFT method.

## 🧩 Features
---
### MaṉaChat:  
A standard instructional chatbot that responds to user inquiries (e.g., “How can I reduce my stress levels?”) using the meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model. 
### MaṉaNow:  
A questioning chatbot that is activated when negative sentiment or concerning patterns are detected. This mode uses the deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 model to dynamically ask a series of assessment questions, and at the end, generate a final report with insights and supportive guidance.
